# Virto Commerce Import Module and Virto Commerce Import App

[![CI status](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-import/workflows/Module%20CI/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-import/actions?query=workflow%3A"Module+CI") 

Virto Commerce Import App is an application that allows the user to import data from external sources, flexibly configure loading parameters, create and use their own adapters for different data sources.

Implements two main ideas:

1. Virto Commerce Import App is a built-in application, which allows you to use it without any additional settings - just install the Import Module, and import capabilities will appear in your Virto working environment. Implements seamless authorization when switching between applications.
1. Provides the developer with a full-fledged Import Framework for implementing data adapters (out-of-the-box it contains a pre-implemented importer from CSV)


## Key Features

1. All-in-one Virto custom-app
